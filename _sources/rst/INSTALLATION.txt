Installation
============

To get up and running with PyMKS, clone the repository

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/wd15/pymks.git

and install with

::

    $ cd pymks
    $ python setup.py install

Check that you can import it and run the tests.

::

    $ python -c "import pymks; pymks.test()"

In all likelihood there will be some errors unless the packages below
are installed.

Additional Requirements
-----------------------

PyMKS will not work without the following packages.

::

    $ pip install numpy
    $ pip install scipy
    $ pip install scikit-learn

`SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__
----------------------------

PyMKS can be used without `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__. However, a
number of the tests depend on `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__ to run and it
is also required to run the elasticity examples.

To install `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__, first clone with

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

and then install with

::

    $ cd sfepy
    $ python setup.py install

See the `SfePy installation
instructions <http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/installation.html>`__ for more
details.

`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`__
-------------------------------

`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`__ is not necessary to use PyMKS, but it
does give improved performance. The main requirement for ``pyfftw`` is
FFTW3, which can be installed via,

::

    $ sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

on Debian/Ubuntu. Windows and Mac users should consult

https://github.com/hgomersall/pyFFTW#platform-specific-build-info

Once this is installed, do

::

    $ pip install pyfftw

Requirements
------------

The `REQUIREMENTS.md <REQUIREMENTS.html>`__ file has a complete list of
packages in the Python environment during development. However, most of
these are certainly not required for running PyMKS.
